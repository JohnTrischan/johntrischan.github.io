README:This project is originally designed to allow user to select their favorite sports team from the four major U.S. sports. The Baseball, Basketball, Football, and Puck on the top left link to the respective leagues score webpages. These various balls will also enlarge and shift to the center for smaller screen sizes. If you select a sport radio button, Javascript will produce an additional radio selection which will display every team within selected sport. Clicking between sport radio buttons will update the team list of radio buttons.
